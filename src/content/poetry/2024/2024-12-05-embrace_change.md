title: Embrace change
---

My hands are stained with blood  
Yours lay as far as they could  
I sit alone with this disease  
A terse desire to cease  

Yet you came back around  
Whispering calmly to my ear -  
Love's nothing to fear, dear -  
As if you hadn't disappeared  

My muscles froze  
My vision fluctuated  
When you came back around  
I wasn't the one you'd found  

That's the thing, my love  
I'm not the same, I'm remade  
You've changed me into this  
Heart-broken tangled cascade  

Now I can't help but feel  
Love's no more than a deal  
Isn't that so strange?  
The will to embrace change
