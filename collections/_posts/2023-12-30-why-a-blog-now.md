This is actually not my first attempt at blogging.

I used to have a blog as a child. Inspired by [my father's talent at writing and counting stories](https://marcadeagua.blogs.sapo.pt/), I created my own blog at just 9 years old. Eventually, I named it *Olhar profundo, factos do mundo*, that you might losely translate to *Deep look at the world's facts*. It might sound a bit cheesy, and it was. I wrote about my trips, my experiences in school and football. As I grew up, I ended up stop writing in it and made the web page private for archive purposes.

*An attempt at recovering OPFM's front page using the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) platform. To my defense, it lost all its [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) here and the beautiful "eye" header it had.*

Some years later, at 17, I had enough of hearing my mother complain about me quitting writing and wrote her an intriguing text about a debate session we had at high school for the students' association electives, or rather, how I did not intervene in it even though I thought I should have.

> Watching a pseudo-debate, I find myself wondering why I decided not to participate, or why I have once again resigned myself to silence when I should be speaking, I who speak so well when I should be referring to silence.

My mom liked it very much and called it a great Christmas gift. I, however, was very intrigued by how the structure of the narrative came to be. It was very circular, and ended in a somewhat perplexed tone, with me opening my house's door after the walk as if nothing had ever happened.

> I get any answer, turn the key, and get into the house.

In my eyes, there was something important going on here. I was a teenager full of dreams and ambitions that collided with a deep sense of sollitude and powerlessness. It was the time to explore those feelings and develop this new style, in private.

From 2019 to 2022, I wrote around 80 posts in *Paradoxo* about dreams, thoughts and dialogs. In the middle of 2023, I thought it was the time to publish some of those, now that my life is changed and I no longer feel the same way about things, and in the hopes that it will be an interesting reading exercise. [*Paradoxo*](/paradoxo) is now published in this web page, in a hopefully attractive standalone frame.

*[Princesa do Norte](/paradoxo/39_princesa_do_norte.html), a poem about desire for a girl that may not be worth it.*

As 2023 reaches its end, I would like to recount some of my stories as a young adult, or be able to write about whatever. It turns out that this personal website might be it, and a new personal writing space is about to flourish.
