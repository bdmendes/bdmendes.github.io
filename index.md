## Hey! I'm Bruno Mendes.

I am a [software engineer](/assets/about-me/bdmendes-cv.pdf) based in [Porto](https://www.porto.pt/en), Portugal. I am currently taking a MSc
in Informatics and Computing Engineering at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en), diving into the world of
software architecture and low level programming.

In my leisure time, I can be found playing some [chess](https://lichess.org/@/brod56), exercising in the
gym, watching a movie, listening to a song or casually wandering around the
city.

Feel free to explore my personal projects and interests.
