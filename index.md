## Hey! I'm Bruno Mendes.

I'm a [software engineer](/assets/about-me/bdmendes-cv.pdf) based in Porto, Portugal, with a degree from the [Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en). My main interests revolve around software engineering, programming languages design and embedded programming. You can find most of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/bdmendes).

I see myself as a perpetual thinker, always questioning the world around me. Sometimes I express these thoughts through [poetry](/poetry), where I channel the darkest energies, or on [my blog](/blog), where I share stories and experiences in a more relaxed tone.

When I'm not coding or writing, you'll probably find me [playing chess](https://lichess.org/@/brod56), hitting the gym, watching a nice movie or wandering around the streets.

If any of this strikes a chord with you, feel free to contact me in your preferred way.
