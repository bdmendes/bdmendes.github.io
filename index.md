### Hey! I'm Bruno Mendes.

Currently doing a [Msc in Informatics and Computer Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=22862) by the [Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto (FEUP)](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_base.gera_pagina?P_pagina=1182), Bruno Mendes is passionate about low level development and software engineering. In his leisure time, he can be seen [playing some chess](https://lichess.org/@/brod56), spending time with family and friends or wandering in the city.
