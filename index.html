<h2>Hey! I'm Bruno Mendes.</h2>

<p>
  I am a Software Engineer based in Porto, Portugal. I am currently taking a MSc
  in Informatics and Computing Engineering at
  <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en">FEUP</a>, diving into the world of
  software architecture and low level programming.
</p>

<p>
  In my leisure time, I can be found playing some
  <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/brod56">chess</a>, exercising in the
  gym, watching a movie, listening to a song or casually wandering around the
  city.
