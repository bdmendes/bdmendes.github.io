title: Psychedelic affairs

Regarding what was said  
Scratch that, shall we?  
I was bitter and resented  
Words came unintended  

Last night I was thinking  
Rather dreaming, meaning  
I was looking for intervening  
A feeling, psychedelic affairs  

We kissed and I lied on you  
Those freaking nightmares!  
Hoped we'd make it to noon  
But I live in an empty saloon
