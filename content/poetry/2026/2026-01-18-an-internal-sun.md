title: An internal sun
---

I once saw a group of teenagers wandering through a dense forest that had emerged beside my house in the village, despite rumors of deforestation taking place all over the country. They discussed politics and the reason for being, but also the deep dark blue color of the sea, near which they would continue the said discussion, sometime later that day. One said that they had found the solution for discerning the tones of blue in the dark. It had something to do with lighting up. A sort of internal sun.
