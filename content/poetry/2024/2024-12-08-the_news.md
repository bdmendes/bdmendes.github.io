When I put on the news  
They said the world was ending  
And a shiver ran down my spine  

It's not that I'm afraid of no sunshine  
Ten thousand storms down the line  
On the contrary, that'll be just fine  

There’s a thought I can’t explain  
I pondered it again and again  
But no clear answer ever came  

Seasons change and I feel so small  
When I'm next to you, my above all  
Will I be worthy of you when it all falls
