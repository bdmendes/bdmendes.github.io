title: The demolition
---

Now if I recall correctly  
We taught everything to each other  
Science, literature, communication  
We taught without knowing  
And it felt so special, because  
It was pure and imprecise  
Steady but not impulsive  
Proven with no proof  

Later we tried to justify things  
Argue with logic and reasoning  
Decide our future in an instant  
Should the world end in the next  

Soon you parted, I stayed  
You stayed, I parted  
You left as a scientist  
I left as a philosopher  

Today my philosophy is fallacious  
Your science is rushed and broken  

I heard our school was demolished
