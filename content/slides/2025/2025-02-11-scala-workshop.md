### What you'll need

- Foundational knowledge of object-oriented programming
  - Java, C++, C# is fine
- Computer science concepts
  - Lexical scopes, loops, variables, functions
  - Recursion (more specifically, search algorithms)
- A computer with an IDE
  - VS Code or IntelliJ are recommended
  
> If any of these concepts is unfamiliar to you, feel free to interrupt me.

### Functional programming concepts

#### What's functional programming? Don't most languages have functions already?

---

### Function composition

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are a *composition of pure functions*
  - Read pure functions as their mathematical counterpart, i.e. *objects* that map inputs to transformed values and have **no side-effects**
  - Functions are **first-class citizens** and may be used as arguments or return values, as any other type

```scala
def transformed(numbers: List[Int], op: Int => Int): List[Int] = { 
    numbers.map(op).toList // How is this implemented?
}

val numbers = List(1, 2, 3)

val doubledNumbers = transformed(numbers, n => n*2)
```

> Think of side-effects as something that mutates the external state of a system. For instance, reading from the console (or any kind of I/O).

---

### Referential transparency

- Pure functions are **predictable** in that they don't change inputs and behave the same given the same input
  - Hence you can replace any subexpression by its value and get the same result
  - This property helps compilers reason about the program more easily and perform optimizations (e.g., *common subexpression elimination*)

```scala 
// This version may throw instead of returning.
// We cannot safely compose this computation.
def opaqueDivide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
    if (b == 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("division by 0") else a / b
}

// Here, we use the `Option` type to clearly state that this function may fail. 
def transparentDivide(a: Int, b: Int): Option[Int] = {
    if (b == 0) None else Some(a / b)
}
```

> `Option` is a monad encapsulating the absence of a value. Monads wrap a value with context, allowing more concise operation chaining. Here e.g. `val result = transparentDivide(10, 2).flatMap(x => transparentDivide(x, 2))` would avoid pattern matching. Monads have well-defined mathematical properties.

---

### Referential transparency

- The lack of referential transparency makes reasoning harder
  - Not being able to perform subexpression substitution leads to unexpected bugs

```scala
def div(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int): Int = {
    val denum = opaqueDivide(b, c)
    try {
      opaqueDivide(a, denum)
    } catch {
      case _ => -1
    }
}
```

```scala
def div(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int): Int = {
    try {
      opaqueDivide(a, opaqueDivide(b, c))
    } catch {
      case _ => -1
    }
}
```

What's the difference between these two?
---

### Evaluation strategies

- Function arguments may be evaluated *eagerly* or *lazily*, depending on the desired semantics
  - Lazy evaluation might help you avoid unneeded computations

```scala
case class User(name: String, age: Int)
case class OrderPlaced(ticketId: Int)

object Store {
    lazy val paymentsSystem: PaymentsSystem = {
      // Here we interact with an hypothetical Java-like API
      // with a synchronous `register` method.
      val sys = new PaymentsSystem()
      sys.register()
      sys
    }
  
    def validUser(user: User): Boolean = user.age >= 18

    def sellWine(user: User, onError: => String): Option[Future[OrderPlaced]] = {
        if (validUser(user)) {
            // `paymentsSystem` is only evaluated here, and only once
            Some(paymentsSystem.place(user))
        } else {
            // `onError` is a long string; by-name evaluation avoids allocations
            log(s"Wine could not be sold: $onError")
            None
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Orthogonal advantages

- Modularity out-of-the-box
  - State is encapsulated by nature and dependencies are explicit
  - Enables test-driven development!
- Maintainability
  - Easier to read and to reason about
- Thread-safety
  - No state is shared, so go ahead and launch computations in several cores!

### Here comes Scala

#### The hybrid object-functional language

---

### Scala

- A flexible, object-functional programming language in the JVM
  - Allows you to make use of the entire ecosystem in a much more functional way
  - Is not rigid, in that it allows to introduce mutable state *when needed*
  - Leverages a very powerful and expressive type-system with OOP support
  
> We'll focus in Scala 3; however, all concepts apply to Scala 2, although possibly with different syntax.

---

### Expressions

```scala
// A value is immutable.
val numbers = List(1, 2, 3)

// A variable is mutable.
var count = 0
count = count + 1

// A function is a first-class citizen.
val odds = (numbers: List[Int]) => numbers.filter(n => n % 2 != 0)

// Methods are evaluated every time they are called.
def calculator = {
    println("Calculating.")
    odds
}

// A value can also be lazily evaluated, but only once.
lazy val numbersDescription = s"Odd numbers are ${calculator(numbers)}"
```

> The best expression type to use depends on the use case.

---

### Classes

```scala
// You may import qualifications as in Java.
import java.util.concurrent.atomic._

// As in Java, you can create a regular class, with some syntax sugar.
class NumberProcessor(numbers: List[Int]) {
    val requests = new AtomicInteger(0)
    def double = {
        requests.incrementAndGet() // How can we "mutate" requests
                                   // when it is a "val"?
        numbers.map(_ * 2).toList
    }
    def requested = requests.get()
}

// And have static symbols under its namespace.
object NumberProcessor {
    def fromOdds(until: Int): NumberProcessor = {
        val odds = (0 to until).filter(_ % 2 != 0).toList
        new NumberProcessor(odds)
    }
}
```

---

### Algebraic Data Types

- ADTs allow structural recursion over types
  - You exhaustively match against a deeply nested type
- Scala provides facilities for implementing *sum* and *product* types

```scala
// A trait is analogous to a Java interface, but with allowed implementations.
// Making it sealed means that it may only be extends in "this" file.
sealed trait Person 

// To adhere to the functional schema, your classes should be immutable.
// A `case class` leverages just that meaning.
case class User(name: String, cookie: Option[String]) extends Person
case class Admin(id: String) extends Person

// And enables pattern matching.
def id(person: Person): String = {
    person match {
        case User(name, _) => s"user-${name}"
        case Admin(id) => id
    }
}
```

> *Sum types* may also be implemented with the modern `enum` keyword.

---

### Type classes and contextual parameters

- Type classes allow implementing ad-hoc behavior
  - We may require a behavior that was not provided by a library
  - Using a contextual parameter often makes your code more expressive

```scala
case class User(age: Int)

// A parameterized type let's you add behavior without subtyping,
// or provide ad-hoc polymorphism. It's informally called a "type class".
trait Comparator[A] {
    def compare(x: A, y: A): Int
}

// It may become cumbersome to pass configurations/implementations around.
// Contextual parameters help capture a value in-scope.
given userComparator: Comparator[User] with {
    def compare(x: User, y: User): Int = Integer.compare(x.age, y.age)
}

// Notice the multiple parameter lists, needed for contextuals.
// `sorted` is defined as Iterable[A] => Comparator[A] => List[A].
def sorted[A](items: Iterable[A])(using comparator: Comparator[A]): List[A] =
  items.toList.sortWith((x, y) => comparator.compare(x, y) < 0)

// No need to pass the comparator around.
println(sorted(List(User(18), User(16))))
```

---

### Immutable collections

```scala
// In functional programming a data structure should also be immutable.
// This is done efficiently by intelligently reusing memory allocations.

def occurences[A](numbers: List[A]): Map[A, Int] = {
  // Notice the private nested looping method.
  @tailrec // What is this for?
  def occurencesInner(list: List[A], acc: Map[A, Int]): Map[A, Int] = {
    list match {
      case Nil => acc
      case x :: xs =>
        occurencesInner(
          xs,
          // The last parameter list of the `updatedWith` method in Map
          // has a single "remapping function" Option[V] => Option[V].
          acc.updatedWith(x) {
            case Some(count) => Some(count + 1)
            case None        => Some(1)
          }
        )
    }
  }
  occurencesInner(numbers, Map.empty[A, Int])
}

println(occurences(List(1, 2, 2, 2)))

```

> Could you implement this with a `foldLeft`? What about with a `foldRight`? What's better?

### Further concepts

For you to dig into at home...

- Asynchronous computations with `Future`

```scala
def fetchUsers: Future[List] = Http.get(...)
```

- Variance

```scala
class List[+A] // A covariant class
               // A List[Duck] is also a List[Animal]

class Printer[-A] // A contravariant class
                  // A Printer[Animal] is also a Printer[Duck]

class Comparator[A] // An invariant class
```

- Abstract type members and type bounds
- Macros
- ...

### A community effort

- Originally created in academia, Scala has evolved into a mature language widely used in industry
  - *Twitter*, *LinkedIn*, *Netflix*, *Lichess*, *Kevel* use Scala to power their backends  

- The native ecosystem is rich
  - [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) â Pure functional abstractions  
  - [Apache Pekko](https://pekko.apache.org/) â Actor-based concurrency
  - [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) â Distributed computing  
  - [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) â Full-stack web framework  
  - [Slick](https://scala-slick.org/) â Functional relational mapping  

Scalaâs ecosystem enables scalable, type-safe, and functional development across diverse domains like **finance, big data, AI and cloud services**.

### Let's get to work!

#### Practical exercise

---

### Setup

- Grab the latest release of `scala`: https://www.scala-lang.org/
  - You may use `Coursier`, the Scala installer CLI
- Grab the latest release of `sbt`: https://www.scala-sbt.org/
  - You may also compile manually, but a build tool helps you `run`, `test` and perform other systematic actions seamlessly
- Grab the workshop source code
  - `git clone https://github.com/bdmendes/n-queens-horses-scala.git`
- Try to run the tests
  - `sbt test`

---

### The problem: *N-Queen-Horses*

- The `N-Queens` is a hard LeetCode problem in which one wants to place `n` queens in a `n*n` board, without them attacking each other, and output available possibilities
  - In their provided example, for `n=4` you have `[[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]`

<img src="/assets/slides/enei-25-scala/nqueens-leetcode.jpg" style="width: 40%;">

- Let's make it a bit more interesting... What if there are already pieces on the board, or if you mant to place knights instead?
  - You'll search not only from an empty board, but from a set of occupied boards in my test cases
  - I'll sometimes ask you to place knights instead of queens
  - No piece can *see* each other!
---

### Our approach

- I've left you some functions to develop in order and tests for each of them
  - Test-driven development will help you reach your goal

```scala
type PieceEntry = (FromTopLeftPosition, Piece)
case class Board(val squares: Vector[Option[Piece]]) {
  // The board, updated with a new piece in the given position.
  def set(pieceEntry: PieceEntry): Board = ???
}
```

```scala
// Whether `entry1` "sees" `entry2`, based on its kind and position.
def attacks(entry1: PieceEntry, entry2: PieceEntry): Boolean = ???
```

```scala
extension (board: Board) {
  // Whether it is safe to place a piece in the board, considering
  // the current board configuration.
  def isSafe(toPlace: PieceEntry) = ???
}
```

```scala
// The boards resulting of safely placing `many` pieces of `kind` in `board`.
def search(board: Board, kind: Piece, many: Int): List[Board] = ???
```

Good luck!
