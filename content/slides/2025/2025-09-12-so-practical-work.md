### Desiderata

---

### Course prerequisites

I expect you to have aced the following course units:

- Programming Fundamentals (**FPro**)
    - Computational thinking
- Programming (**Prog**)
    - The C language
- Computer Architecture (**AC**)
    - Memory layers: registers, main memory (stack)

If you are not familiar with these topics, you **must** use these first classes to catch up! Speak up.

---

### Course objectives

- Learn **how an OS is implemented** -> theorethicals
  - How its functionality is split into layers
  - The protection and encapsulation principles that motivate its API
- Learn about **core OS services** -> theorethicals + practicals
  - How they allow functionality to be developed easily in user space
- Exercise **systems-level programming** -> practicals
  - Interact with POSIX/libc APIs in Linux

---

### Grading

- 100%: Exam
  - 1 intermediate test in Moodle covering half of the syllabus (50%)
  - 1 final test in Moodle covering the other half of the syllabus (50%)
  - Both with a theorethical and a practical part
  - You'll have to write code in the practical part

> The exercises you'll tackle in class will be essential for the practical section of the tests.

### Our plan

---

### TPs Agenda

- [1w] F0: Shell
- [2w] F1/F2: C Programming Language
- [2w] F3: File manipulation (libc: fread, fwrite, ...)
- [2w] F4: File manipulation (kernel API: open, read, write, ...)

---

### How you'll work

- Individually
  - But I don't mind if you gather in groups and discuss the exercises with colleagues
  - Do not skip exercises!
  - Do not use AI! Exercise your mind.
- Responsibly
  - You are adults, I expect you to behave as such
  - If you miss a class, it's your responsibility to catch up
  - If you have questions, ask me (during class, or by email -> [bdmendes@fe.up.pt](mailto:bdmendes@fe.up.pt))

---

### What OS do I need?

- **Linux** is your best option
  - UNIX; very POSIX-compliant, the most reliable environment for this course
  - You can install it in a VM (e.g., VirtualBox) or dual-boot it
  - I recommend Ubuntu or Fedora
- A Mac is fine, but you might want to use *bash* instead of *zsh*
  - macOS is also UNIX but so some things might be slightly different
  - For example, system utilities are not GNU versions and might have different flags
- Windows will **not** work for this course

---

class: center, middle, inverse

### F0: Shell

---

### What's a shell?

- One of the main ways to interact with an OS is via direct command input (*CLI*)
- A *shell* is an interactive command interpreter (REPL)
  - Has some built-in commands (*cd*, *exit*, ...)
  - Mostly delegates functionality to user programs (*ls*, *grep*, ...)
- Some common examples include *bash*, *zsh* and *fish*
  - *bash* is the most commonly used and very POSIX-compliant
  - *zsh* is fine; *fish* is not POSIX-compliant, so please skip it for this course

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

```sh
$ chmod +x myscript.sh
$ ./myscript.sh
```

---

### Bash + GNU utilities 101

```bash
# Print the contents of a directory
$ ls -l <mydir>

# Print current working directory
$ pwd

# Change current working directory
$ cd <mydir>

# Write the contents of a file to another file
# The `>` operator redirects output to a file
$ cat <file1> > <file2>

# Search for a pattern in a file
# The `|` operator pipes the output of one command to another
$ cat <file> | grep <pattern>

# Environment variables are accessible by programs
$ echo $HOME
$ export MYVAR="myvalue"
$ env

# The "PATH" variable is special
# It lists directories where the shell looks for executables
# e.g. /usr/bin, /bin, /usr/local/bin, ...
$ echo $PATH
```

---

### Your best friend

- The best way to know how a system API (either system program or libc function) works is to read its manual page
- You can access it via the `man` command

```bash
man [page] <topic> # e.g. `man 1 write` should give you
                   # the manual for the write system binary
                   # 
                   # `man 2 write` should give you
                   # the manual for the write libc function
```

```txt
grep(1) â€” Linux manual page

NAME

       grep - print lines that match patterns

SYNOPSIS

       grep [OPTION]... PATTERNS [FILE]...
       grep [OPTION]... -e PATTERNS ... [FILE]...
       grep [OPTION]... -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION

       grep searches for patterns in each FILE. [...]

### F1/F2: C Programming Language

---

### Where we are

- You already know C from the Programming course
  - But you probably abused some of C++ features and might need a refresher
- Depending on who you ask, C might be considered a high-level or low-level language
  - It is a high-level language because it abstracts away many low-level details (CPU instructions, architecture-specific features, ...)
  - It is a **low-level language** because it provides direct access to memory and hardware (e.g., pointers, bitwise operations)
- In any case, C is historically **the language of choice for systems programming**
  - It is used to implement operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications
  - Rust might be taking over this role in the future, but C is still very relevant - the Linux kernel is as of now mostly C/ASM with a hint of Rust

---

### How a program is compiled

- You write some code in a `.c` file
- The C compiler (e.g. `gcc`) performs:
  - **Preprocessing**: handles directives like `#include` and `#define`
  - **Code analysis**: checks for syntax and semantic errors (based on a AST)
  - **Code generation**: translates C code to assembly code (architecture-dependent file, `.s`)
  - **Assembly**: converts assembly code to position-independent machine code (object file, `.o`)
  - **Linking**: combines object files and libraries into an executable (binary, e.g., ELF format)
- The loader (e.g. `ld.so`) loads the executable into memory and starts its execution when the shell calls `execve()`

```bash
$ gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c # you might need to link some libraries
                               # e.g., `-lm` for the math library
$ ./myprogram
```

---

### Beyond basic programs

- In the real world, code must be modular and reusable
- C provides several mechanisms to achieve this:
  - **Header files** (`.h`): declare functions, macros, constants, and data types
  - **Source files** (`.c`): define the actual implementation of functions and data structures
  - **Static libraries** (`.a`): collections of object files that can be linked into programs at compile time
  - **Dynamic libraries** (`.so`): shared libraries that are loaded at runtime, allowing for code reuse and memory efficiency
  
> There are many tools to help you manage complex C projects, such as `make`. They abstract way some of the complexities of manually resorting to `gcc`, `ar`, etc on ever-growing projects.

---

### Memory: the big monster (1/2)

- You **must** deal with memory manually in C
- Under the hood, your data will be stored in different memory segments:
  - The **registers**: e.g. local variables and function arguments with size up to arch-width (probably 64 bits)
    ```c
      int a = 42; // possibly stored in a register, if the function is small
    ```
  - The **stack**: e.g. local variables and function arguments with known size; get automatically "freed" when the block ends
    ```c
      int arr[100]; // stored in the stack
    ```
  - The **heap**: e.g. dynamically allocated memory with unknown size; you must manually free it when done; less efficient
    ```c
      int size;
      scanf("%d", &size); // be careful!
      int *ptr = malloc(size * (sizeof int));
      if (ptr == NULL) exit(1);
      some_use(ptr);
      free(ptr);
    ```

---

### Memory: the big monster (2/2)

- Pointers allow you to directly manipulate memory addresses
  - A pointer is a variable that stores a memory address
  - You can use pointers to create complex data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees) and to manage dynamic memory
  - Pointer arithmetic allows you to navigate through arrays and memory blocks
  ```c
    int a[2] = {42, 43}; // `a` is an array of 2 integers; 4+4 bytes
    int *p = &a; // `p` now holds the address of `a[0]`
    printf("%d\n", *(p + 1)); // prints `43`
  ```
- In C, all variables are passed by copy!
  - There is no "pointer in disguise" C++ `&` type qualifier
  - When you call some `f` declared as `int f(int* v)`, the location of `v` is copied to the stack/registers and passed to `f`
  - You must dereference it to access or modify the value it points to: `*v`

---

### Data layouts

- Composition might not be straightforward in C
  - A function returns one and only one value, likely in a fixed register
  - Primitive types (e.g., `int`, `char`, `float`) have a fixed size and unknown semantics in the context of your program
- Fortunately, C provides some mechanisms to create complex data types:
  - Structs (`struct`) allow you to group related data together -> size = sum of field sizes + padding
  - Unions (`union`) allow you to store different data types in the same memory location -> size = max of field sizes
  - Enums (`enum`) allow you to define a set of named integer constants, likely compiled as `int`
- `typedef` might come-in handy to create type aliases

### F3/F4: File manipulation and more C

---

### Customizing the behavior of your program

- In the real world, programs read settings from many sources:
  - **Command-line arguments**: passed to the program when it is executed
  - **Environment variables**: inherited from the parent process (e.g., the shell)
  - **Configuration files**: read at runtime to load settings
- We'll focus on command-line arguments and environment variables for now

---

### Command-line arguments

- The `main` function can be defined as `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`
  - `argc` is the number of command-line arguments (including the program name)
  - `argv` is an array of strings (character pointers) representing the arguments
  
```c
#include <stdio.h> // for printf

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```bash
$ ./myprogram arg1 arg2 arg3
Argument 0: ./myprogram
Argument 1: arg1
Argument 2: arg2
Argument 3: arg3
```

---

### Environment variables

- Environment variables are key-value pairs that can influence the behavior of processes
- You can access them using the `getenv` function from `stdlib.h`

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // for printf
#include <stdlib.h> // for getenv

int main() {
    char *path = getenv("PATH");
    if (path != NULL) {
        printf("PATH: %s\n", path);
    } else {
        printf("PATH variable not found.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```bash
$ ./myprogram
PATH: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/
```

---

### Strings

- Strings in C are arrays of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`)
- The standard library (`string.h`) provides several functions to manipulate strings

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // for printf
#include <string.h> // for strlen, strcpy, strcat, strcmp

int main() {
    char str1[8] = "Hello, "; // 7 chars + 1 for '\0'
                              // What happens if we write more than 7 chars?!
    char str2[] = "World!"; // the size is inferred
    
    // Concatenate str2 to str1 -> O(n + m)
    strcat(str1, str2);
    printf("Concatenated: %s\n", str1);
    
    // Length of the concatenated string -> O(n)
    printf("Length: %zu\n", strlen(str1));
    
    // Compare two strings -> O(n)
    if (strcmp(str1, "Hello, World!") == 0) {
        printf("Strings are equal.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Strings are not equal.\n");
    }
}
```

---

### Lists

- Linked lists are a common alternative to arrays that allows dynamic sizing; implemented ad-hoc by libraries
  - Each element (node) contains data and a pointer to the next node
  - They provide O(1) insertion and deletion time but O(n) access time
  
```c
#include <stdio.h>  // for printf
#include <stdlib.h> // for malloc, free

typedef struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
} Node;

typedef List Node;

List* l_create(int data); // creates a node in the heap such that
                          // node->data = data and node->next = NULL
                          
List* l_push(List *head, int data); // returns a new node such that
                                    // node->data = data and node->next = *head
                                    
int l_at(List *head, int idx); // returns the data at position `idx`

void l_free(List *head); // frees all nodes in the list
```

---

### File manipulation with libc

- The C standard library (`stdio.h`) provides a high-level API for file manipulation
- Files are represented by the `FILE` type, which is an abstraction over system file descriptors

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // for FILE, fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite
#include <stdlib.h> // for exit

int main() {
    // Open a file for reading
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Read data from the file
    char buffer[256];
    size_t bytes_read = fread(buffer, sizeof char, (sizeof buffer) - 1, file);
    buffer[bytes_read] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the string
    printf("Read %zu bytes: %s\n", bytes_read, buffer);

    // Close the file
    fclose(file);
    return 0;
}
```

---

### File manipulation with kernel API

- The POSIX standard provides a low-level API for file manipulation via system calls
- They provide more control over file operations but are less portable
  - E.g. you may modify the file access permissions, locking, etc
- Remember that directories are also files!

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // for perror
#include <stdlib.h>  // for exit
#include <fcntl.h>   // for open, O_RDONLY
#include <unistd.h>  // for read, write, close

int main() {
    // Open a file for reading
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);

    // Read data from the file
    char buffer[256];
    ssize_t bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, (sizeof buffer) - 1);
    buffer[bytes_read] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the string
    printf("Read %zd bytes: %s\n", bytes_read, buffer);

    // Close the file
    close(fd);
}
```

---

### Bitwise operations

- Whilst working with file permissions (see `stat`) and many other I/O-related tasks, you will need to manipulate bits directly

```c
int some_mask = 0x04; // binary: 0000 0100
                      // there are also octal literals (prefixed by 0, e.g `0777`)
                      // binary literals are not in the C standard
                      
// Activate bit 1
some_mask |= (1 << 1); // now some_mask is 0000 0110

// Deactivate bit 2
some_mask &= ~(1 << 2); // now some_mask is 0000 0010

// Check if bit 2 is active
int active = (some_mask & (1 << 2)) ? 1 : 0; // 0

// Toggle bit 0 (via XOR)
some_mask ^= (1 << 0); // now some_mask is 0000 0011
```

- Storing data in bits is memory-efficient and fast
  - But it can be error-prone and hard to read, so use it wisely
  - Most of the times you define macros that abstract away the bitwise operations in the specific context

---

### Time in UNIX-land

- Time is often represented as the number of seconds since the "UNIX epoch" (January 1, 1970)
  - This is known as "Unix time" or "POSIX time"
- The `time.h` library provides functions to work with time and date

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // for printf
#include <time.h>    // for time, localtime, strftime

int main() {
    time_t now = time(NULL); // get current time in seconds since epoch
    struct tm *local = localtime(&now); // convert to local time structure

    char buffer[80];
    strftime(buffer, sizeof buffer, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", local);
    printf("Current local time: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

### F5: Processes

---

### Processes

- At a high level, the materialization of a running program is called a *process*
  - It has its own memory space (virtual memory), file descriptors, and execution context (registers, stack, ...)
  - The kernel keeps its information in a data structure called *process control block* (PCB)
- A process may manage and communicate with other processes
  - A process that creates another process is called a *parent*; the created process is a *child*
  - One may create a process using the `fork()` system call
  - One may replace itself with another program using the `exec()` family of system calls
  - A parent may wait for a child to finish using the `wait()` family of system calls
- More advanced ways of communicating soon...

---

### Dispatching computations to processes

- Some tasks are naturally parallel and independent and can be split into multiple processes
  - E.g., a web browser typically spawns a new process for each tab

```c
#include <stdio.h>    // for printf, perror
#include <stdlib.h>   // for exit
#include <unistd.h>   // for fork, exec, _exit
#include <sys/wait.h> // for wait

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork(); // create a new process
                        // might do so in bulk...
    if (pid < 0) {
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process; variables copied via copy-on-write (CoW)
        char *args[] = {"/bin/ls", "-l", NULL};
        execv(args[0], args); // replace child with `ls -l`
    } else {
        // Parent process
        int status;
        waitpid(pid, &status, 0); // wait for child to finish
        if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
            printf("Child exited with status %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
        }
    }
}
```

---

class: center, middle, inverse

### F6: Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

---

### Why IPC?

- Processes are isolated from each other by the OS for security and stability
  - Each process has its own memory space, file descriptors, and execution context
- However, processes often need to communicate and share data
  - E.g., a web server process might need to communicate with a database process
- IPC mechanisms provide ways for processes to exchange data and synchronize their actions
  - Some IPC mechanisms are suitable for small amounts of data and low latency (e.g. pipes)
  - Others are suitable for larger amounts of data and more complex interactions (e.g. shared memory)
  - Many others: files, signals, message queues, sockets, ...
  
---

### Pipes

- A pipe is a unidirectional communication channel that can be used for IPC
  
```c
#include <stdio.h>    // for printf, perror
#include <stdlib.h>   // for exit
#include <unistd.h>   // for fork, pipe, read, write, close
#include <string.h>   // for strlen

int main() {
    int fd[2];
    pipe(fd);
    pid_t pid = fork();
    
    if (pid < 0) {
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        close(fd[0]); // Close unused read end
        const char *msg = "Hello from child!";
        write(fd[1], msg, strlen(msg));
        close(fd[1]); // Close write end
    } else {
        // Parent process
        close(fd[1]); // Close unused write end
        char buffer[256];
        ssize_t bytes_read = read(fd[0], buffer, (sizeof buffer) - 1);
        printf("Parent received: %s\n", buffer);
        close(fd[0]); // Close read end
    }
}
```

---

### Named pipes (FIFOs) (1/2)

- A named pipe (FIFO) is a special type of file that acts as a pipe
  - It can be used for IPC between unrelated processes
  - It is created using the `mkfifo()` system call or the `mkfifo` utility
- Supports bidirectional communication:
  - Many processes may write to the same pipe
  - Many processes may read from the same pipe, but the OS ensures that each message is read by only one reader
  
---

### Named pipes (FIFOs) (2/2)

```c
#include <stdio.h>    // for printf, perror
#include <stdlib.h>   // for exit
#include <unistd.h>   // for fork, read, write, close, unlink
#include <fcntl.h>    // for open, O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY
#include <string.h>   // for strlen
#include <sys/stat.h> // for mkfifo

int main() {
    const char *fifo_path = "/tmp/my_fifo";
    mkfifo(fifo_path, 0666); // create the FIFO with read/write permissions
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        int fd = open(fifo_path, O_WRONLY);
        const char *msg = "Hello from child!";
        write(fd, msg, strlen(msg));
        close(fd);
    } else {
        // Parent process
        int fd = open(fifo_path, O_RDONLY);
        char buffer[256];
        ssize_t bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, (sizeof buffer) - 1);
        buffer[bytes_read] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the string
        printf("Parent received: %s\n", buffer);
        close(fd);
        unlink(fifo_path); // "delete" the FIFO
    }
}
```

---

### Signals

- Signals are a form of asynchronous notification sent to a process to notify it of an event
  - E.g., `SIGTERM` is sent to request a process to terminate gracefully - highly used e.g. by Kubernetes!
  
```c
#include <stdio.h>    // for printf, perror
#include <stdlib.h>   // for exit
#include <unistd.h>   // for fork, pause
#include <signal.h>   // for signal, SIGINT, SIGCHLD
#include <sys/wait.h> // for wait

// Provide a handler to this particular signal.
// Some handlers are non-reprogrammable (e.g., SIGKILL); handled by the OS.
void handle_sigterm(int sig) {
    printf("Caught SIGINT (signal %d). Exiting gracefully...\n", sig);
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGTERM, handle_sigint); // Register signal handler
    pause(); // Wait for signals
    return 0;
}
```

```bash
$ ./myprogram
$ ps # find its PID
$ kill -SIGINT <PID>
```

---

### Sockets

- Sockets provide a way for processes to communicate over a network
  - They can be used for IPC on the same machine (using Unix domain sockets) or between machines (using TCP/IP)
  - The `AF_UNIX` family is used for IPC on the same host machine

```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    char buf[1024]; int sockets[2];
    socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, sockets);
    int pid = fork();
    if (pid > 0) { /* parent */
        char string1[] = "In every walk with nature...";
        close(sockets[1]);
        write(sockets[0], string1, sizeof string1);
        read(sockets[0], buf, sizeof buf);
        printf("message from %d-->%s\n", getpid(), buf);
        close(sockets[0]);
        wait(NULL);
    } else { /* child */
        char string2[] = "...one receives far more than he seeks.";
        close(sockets[0]);
        read(sockets[1], buf, sizeof buf);
        printf("message from %d-->%s\n", getppid(), buf);
        write(sockets[1], string2, sizeof string2);
        close(sockets[1]);

### F7: Threads

---

### Why threads?

- Some tasks are very naturally tailored to be executed in parallel in the same process
  - E.g., a web server might spawn a new thread for each incoming request
  - Although in practice threads are not infinite and a thread pool is used (likely implemented via a queue)
- Threads are more lightweight than processes
  - They share the same memory space and file descriptors, which makes context switching faster
  - However, this also means that threads must be carefully synchronized, if they attempt access to shared data

---

### Creating and managing threads

- The POSIX threads (`pthreads`) library provides a standard API for creating and managing threads in C

```c
void* thread_function(void* arg) {
    char* message = (char*)arg;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%s: iteration %d\n", message, i);
        struct timespec ts = {0, 500000000}; // 0.5 seconds
        nanosleep(&ts, NULL); // sleep for a while to simulate work
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread1, thread2;
    const char* msg1 = "Thread 1";
    const char* msg2 = "Thread 2";

    if (pthread_create(&thread1, NULL, thread_function, (void*)msg1) != 0) {
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    if (pthread_create(&thread2, NULL, thread_function, (void*)msg2) != 0) {
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    pthread_join(thread1, NULL); // Wait for thread 1 to finish
    pthread_join(thread2, NULL); // Wait for thread 2 to finish
}
```

---

### Synchronizing threads

- You need to use a synchronization mechanism if you need a certain semantic when accessing shared data, e.g. you might want to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time
- Mutexes (mutual exclusion locks) are a common way to achieve this; semaphores and monitors are other options

```c
static int counter = 0; // shared resource
pthread_mutex_t counter_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER; // static initializer

void* increment(void* arg) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&counter_mutex); // lock the mutex
    counter++; // critical section
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&counter_mutex); // unlock the mutex
                                          // what happens if we forget to do this?
}

int main () {
    pthread_t threads[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, increment, NULL);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }
    printf("Final counter value: %d\n", counter);
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&counter_mutex); // destroy the mutex when done
}
```
