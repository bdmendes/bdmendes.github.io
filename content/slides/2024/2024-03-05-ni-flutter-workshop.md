### What is Flutter?

- A framework developed by Google for building near-native **cross-platform** apps
- Uses **Dart**, a statically-typed, compiled, null-safe programming-language built with UI development in mind
- Provides facilities such as **hot-reload** and **hot-restart** for fast development

## But I only know Python/JS/...!

#### No worries, Dart is easy to learn

---

### Dart 101

Dart is an imperative, object-oriented language with some functional features.

```dart
class NumbersProcessor {
    NumbersProcessor(this.numbers); // Class constructor

    List<int> _numbers; // Class private field (notice the underscore)

    // Class method
    int sum() {
        // Notice the arrow function syntax, enabling a functional style
        final sum = _numbers.reduce((value, element) => value + element);
        return sum;
    }
}

void main() {
    // Variable declaration
    List<int> someNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    NumbersProcessor processor = NumbersProcessor(someNumbers);

    // Function call
    print(processor.sum());
}
```

---

### Dart specials: null-safety

In most languages that support objects, you can assign `null` to a variable of the type of that object. That pattern is useful for portraying the absence of a value, but it can lead to bugs.

```dart
void main() {
    String errorDescription = null;
    printError(errorDescription);
}

void printError(String description) {
    // Here we check if the description is null
    // But what if we forget to check? Boom!
    if (errorDescription != null) {
        print("Error: " + errorDescription);
    } else {
        print("Generic error");
    }
}
```

> "I call it [the null reference] my billion-dollar mistake." - Tony Hoare

---

### Dart specials: null-safety

Since Dart 2.12, the language supports null-safety, which means that you can't assign `null` to a variable unless you explicitly declare it as nullable.

This is a pattern that is also used in Kotlin and Swift. Some other languages, such as Rust, don't even have the concept of `null` and force the developer to use semantic types such as `Option` or `Result`.

```dart
void main() {
    // Nullable types are suffixed with a question mark
    // If not declared as nullable, the compiler will not let you assign null
    String? errorDescription = null;
    printError(errorDescription);
}

void printError(String? description) {
    // The compiler will force you to check if the description is null
    if (errorDescription != null) {
        print("Error: " + errorDescription);
    } else {
        print("Generic error");
    }

    // Notice the null-aware operator
    // You can alternatively use the "bang" operator (!)
    // to force the compiler to ignore null-safety
    print("Error length: " + errorDescription?.length);
}
```

---

### Dart specials: asynchronous programming

Some things in life take time. How awkward would it be if UI interaction in _uni_ was suspended while the app was waiting for a response from _Sigarra_, the fastest information system in the world?

Older languages such as Java or C/C++ force you to use explicit threads to perform asynchronous operations. Modern languages have built-in support for asynchronous programming. In Dart, one relies on the `Future` class.

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<http.Response> fetchLectures() {
    final uri = Uri.parse('sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/mob_hor_geral.estudante');
    return http.get(uri);
}

// If a function is marked as async, it can use the await keyword
void main() async {
    // Wait for the execution of the fetchLectures function before continuing
    // Alternatively, you can use the "then" method of the Future class
    final response = await fetchLectures();
    final json = jsonDecode(response.body);
    print(json);
}
```

---

### Dart specials: miscellaneous

- **Generics** are supported, but they are not as powerful as templates in C++
- **Extension methods** allow you to add methods to existing classes, e.g. the built-in `String` class
- **Mixins** allow you to add functionality to classes without using inheritance, equivalent to traits in Rust
- **Inheritance** is supported, but only single inheritance (thank god)
- **Exceptions** are supported, but methods need not declare them in their signature (unlike Java)
- **Pattern matching** is supported, e.g. in `switch` statements since Dart 3.0

> "Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary." - Richard Holt (University of Waterloo)

## So now I know Dart (kinda)

#### How do I build a Flutter app?

---

### Flutter: Getting started

For developing Flutter apps, you need:

- The Flutter SDK (which includes the Dart SDK)
- Platform-specific SDKs and/or IDEs
  - Android: Android Studio + Android SDK
  - iOS: Xcode + iOS SDK
  - Linux: C/C++ toolchain
  - Web: Chrome
  - ...
- A lot of patience for the first build

> In Flutter's defense, the first build is the only one that takes a long time, since you can use hot-reload and hot-restart to quickly iterate on your code later on. Also, transpilation to native code is not an easy task and also takes time in other frameworks, such as React Native.

---

### Flutter essentials: Widgets

- In Flutter, everything is a widget expressed in code
- Widgets are arranged in a tree structure and are rendered on a canvas provided by the platform
- Widgets (and its children) are rebuilt everytime their state changes, e.g. when a button is pressed
- The Flutter framework provides a set of built-in widgets, but you can also create your own

<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/widget_tree.gif" style="width: 80%;">

---

### Flutter essentials: Stateless widgets

**Stateless widgets** are immutable and are suitable for static UI elements (such as images) or UI actions (triggering a change on a parent stateful widget).

```dart
class LikeButton extends StatelessWidget {
    // onPressed is a required named parameter
    LikeButton({required this.onPressed});

    Function() onPressed;

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return TextButton(
            // onPressed is a callback that will be invoked
            // by the UI thread as a response to a tap event.
            // It will run on a separate thread.
            onPressed: onPressed,
            child: Text("Like"),
        );
    }
}
```

---

### Flutter essentials: Stateful widgets

**Stateful widgets** are mutable and are suitable for UI elements that change over time (such as a counter or a list of items fetched from an API).

You can use the `setState` method to trigger a rebuild of the widget and its children, by passing a callback that updates the widget's state.

```dart
class PostLike extends StatefulWidget {
    @override
    PostLikeState createState() => PostLikeState();
}

class PostLikeState extends State<PostLike> {
    int _likes = 0;

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Row(
            children: [
                Text("Likes: $_likes"),
                const SizedBox(width: 8),
                LikeButton(
                    onPressed: () => setState(() => _likes = likes + 1),
                ),
            ],
        );
    }
}
```

---

### Flutter essentials: Context

The `context` is a reference to the widget's location in the widget tree. It can be used to obtain access to global services such as the `Theme` or the `Navigator`.

```dart
class LikeButton extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        // The context can be used to obtain access to global services
        final theme = Theme.of(context);
        return TextButton(
            onPressed: () {
                // The Navigator can be used to navigate to other screens,
                // enabling patterns that the user expects
                // such as the back button on Android.
                // You can define your own routes in the MaterialApp widget.
                Navigator.of(context).pushNamed("/likes");
            },
            child: Text("Like"),
            style: TextButton.styleFrom(
                primary: theme.primaryColor,
            ),
        );
    }
}
```

---

### Flutter essentials: Layout

To be able to build complex UIs, you need to be able to arrange widgets in a layout, much like you would use CSS's Flexbox or Grid:

- `Row` and `Column` widgets allow you to arrange widgets horizontally and vertically, respectively.
- Others such as `Center` and `Expanded` signal their parent that their children should be displayed in a way that exceeds their natural size.
- `Container` is a widget that allows you to add padding, margin, borders, etc. to its child.

### Flutter essentials: Material Design

Material Design is a design language developed by Google that is used in many of its products, such as Android and Chrome OS. Flutter provides a set of widgets that implement the Material Design guidelines, and are customizable to fit your needs, e.g. through the `Theme` widget.

## Is this enough?

#### Maybe, but you might be missing some important concepts

---

### Flutter advanced: State management

In applications, it is common to have global state that is useful to sibling or distant widgets in the widget tree. For example, a user's authentication state is useful to many widgets in the app.

A solution known so far would be to pass the user authentication state as a parameter to every widget that needs it. This is not only cumbersome, but also error-prone. Some call it _prop drilling_ or _callback hell_.

Fortunately, packages such as `redux` and `provider` (or its successor `riverpod`) provide solutions to this problem. `BLoC` is also popular.

<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/provider.jpg" style="width: 70%;">

---

### Flutter advanced: Platform channels

Sometimes you need to access platform-specific APIs, such as the camera or the GPS. For that, Flutter provides a mechanism called **platform channels**.

```dart
final batteryLevel = await platform.invokeMethod<int>('getBatteryLevel');
setState(() {
    // Notice we only update the state after the platform call returns,
    // since setState is synchronous
    _batteryLevel = result;
});
```

```kotlin
override fun onMethodCall(call: MethodCall, result: Result) {
  if (call.method == "getBatteryLevel") {
    val batteryLevel = getBatteryLevel()
    if (batteryLevel != -1) {
      result.success(batteryLevel)
    } else {
      result.error("UNAVAILABLE", "Battery level not available.", null)
    }
  } else {
    result.notImplemented()
  }
}

private fun getBatteryLevel(): Int {
  val batteryManager = getSystemService(Context.BATTERY_SERVICE) as BatteryManager
  return batteryManager.getIntProperty(BatteryManager.BATTERY_PROPERTY_CAPACITY)
}
```

---

### Flutter advanced: Offline storage

Flutter provides a set of packages that allow you to store data locally on the device, such as `shared_preferences` (key-value storage) and `sqflite` (SQLite database).

```dart
final sharedPreferences = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
final savedUsername = await sharedPreferences.getString("username");
```

```dart
final db = await openDatabase('my_db.db');
final savedUsername = await
    db
    .query("users", where: "id = ?", whereArgs: [1])
    .then((rows) => rows.first["username"]);
```

The choice of storage depends on the complexity of the data you want to store. For simple data, `shared_preferences` is enough. For more complex data, you should use `sqflite`, or even a NoSQL database such as `hive`.

---

### Flutter advanced: Architecture

Real-world applications are large and complex and thus require a well-defined architecture to be maintainable. Flutter is no exception.

A common architecture for reactive applications is **MVC** (Model-View-Controller):

- **Model**: the data layer, i.e. the classes that represent entities in the application (e.g. a `User` class). May also contain state management logic.
- **View**: the UI layer, i.e. the widgets that are rendered on the screen
- **Controller**: the business logic layer, i.e. the classes that handle the application's logic (e.g. a `UserService` class that handles API calls and writes to the database)

<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/mvc.png" style="width: 60%;">

---

### Flutter advanced: Best practices

- Use `const` whenever possible
- Keep the state local to the widget that needs it if possible, i.e. do not overuse global state management
- Extract widgets to separate files to keep your code clean and avoid heavy rebuilds
- Use a static code analyzer ("linter") to keep your code formatted, clean and consistent
- Do not put complex business logic in the UI layer
- Do not reinvent the wheel: use packages from the community whenever possible
- Test your code, especially the business logic layer

class: center, middle, inverse

### So you are now a Flutter expert

#### Let's get our hands dirty. Can you build this (or better)?

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; gap: 2em">
<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/practical/fetch_news.png" style="height: 50vh;">
<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/practical/news_details.png" style="height: 50vh;">
</div>

---

### Bootstrapping a new project

- Make sure you have Flutter well configured on your machine:

```sh
flutter doctor
```

- Create a new Flutter project and run it on your device:

```sh
flutter create news_app && cd news_app && flutter run
```

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/practical/new_project.png" style="height: 50vh;">
</div>

---

### Removing some demo code

- Change the accent color to `Colors.blue`
- Change the title of the app to "News App"
- Remove the counter, the increment button and the center text

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/practical/blank_project.png" style="height: 50vh;">
</div>

---

### Creating a news card widget

- Create a new file `news_card.dart` and define a `NewsCard` stateless widget
- You can hardcode some strings for now
- Wrap the `Card` widget and customize as you see fit
- Add it on the homepage

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/practical/news_card.png" style="height: 50vh;">
</div>

---

### Creating a news card widget

```dart
class NewsCard extends StatelessWidget {
  const NewsCard({super.key});
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
        child: Row(
      children: [
        Container(
            child: Image.network(
              "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105692413-1548173252068gettyimages-450710900.jpeg?v=1548173273",
              fit: BoxFit.cover,
            )),
        const Expanded(
            child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            Text(
              "Ronaldo is upset",
            ),
            Text(
                "He is getting a bit old and it's somewhat hard to drible. Still a legend though."),
          ],
        ))
      ],
    ));
  }
}
```

---

### Making the widget reusable

- Create a new file `news_article.dart` and define a `NewsArticle` class that holds the article's data
- Make the `NewsCard` widget accept a `NewsArticle` object as a parameter and use it to populate the children fields
- Create some articles on the homepage using a ListView

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/practical/listview.png" style="height: 50vh;">
</div>

---

### Making the widget reusable

```dart
class NewsArticle {
  String? imageUrl;
  String title;
  String subtitle;

  NewsArticle({this.imageUrl, required this.title, required this.subtitle});
}
```

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
        child: Row(
        children: [
        Container(
            child: Image.network(
                article.imageUrl ??
                    "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105692413-1548173252068gettyimages-450710900.jpeg?v=1548173273",
                fit: BoxFit.cover)),
        Expanded(
            child: Column(
            children: [
                Text(article.title),
                Text(article.subtitle),
            ],
        ))
        ],
    ));
}
```

---

### Making the widget reusable

```dart
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final List<NewsArticle> articles = [
    NewsArticle(
        title: "Ronaldo is beautiful",
        subtitle: "At least according to Georgina."),
    NewsArticle(
        title: "FC Porto beats Benfica",
        subtitle: "It seemed like it was a Champions League game",
        imageUrl:
            "https://sportal365images.com/process/smp-images-production/abola.pt/03032024/b61a1758-33bd-4f8a-af5d-a6037c287b89.jpg")
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Container(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
          child: ListView(
            children: articles.map((article) => NewsCard(article)).toList(),
          )),
    );
  }
}
```

---

### Fetching some actual data

- Create a new file `articles_fetcher.dart` and add a function to fetch articles from a remote API
  - I suggest you use `https://saurav.tech/NewsAPI/top-headlines/category/<category>/in.json`
  - Make sure that your function returns `Future<List<NewsArticle>>`
  - You need to add the `http` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file
- Use a `FutureBuilder` widget to display the articles on the homepage

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/practical/fetch_news.png" style="height: 50vh;">
</div>

---

### Fetching some actual data

```dart
Future<List<NewsArticle>> fetchArticles(String category) async {
  final response = await get(Uri.parse(
      "https://saurav.tech/NewsAPI/top-headlines/category/$category/in.json"));
  final json = jsonDecode(response.body);
  final articles = (json["articles"] as List).map((article) {
    return NewsArticle(
        title: article["title"],
        subtitle: article["description"],
        imageUrl: article["urlToImage"]);
  }).toList();
  return articles;
}
```

```dart
FutureBuilder(
    future: fetchArticles("sports"),
    builder: (BuildContext context,
        AsyncSnapshot<List<NewsArticle>> snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasError) {
            return Text("Error: ${snapshot.error}");
        }

        if (snapshot.hasData) {
            return ListView(
                children: snapshot.data!.map((a) => NewsCard(a)).toList());
        }

        return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
    },
)
```

---

### Implementing a details page

- Add a `content` field to the `NewsArticle` model class and update the fetcher accordingly
- Create a new file `news_details.dart` and define a `NewsDetails` page
- Navigate to the details page route when tapping the news card (e.g use a `InkWell` widget)

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
<img src="/assets/slides/flutter-24-ni/practical/news_details.png" style="height: 50vh;">
</div>

---

### Implementing a details page: the page

```dart
class NewsDetailsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final NewsArticle article;

  const NewsDetailsPage(this.article, {super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
          title: Text(article.title),
        ),
        body: ListView(children: [
          if (article.imageUrl != null) Image.network(article.imageUrl!),
          Text(article.title, style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 20),),
          if (article.content != null) Text(article.content!),
        ]));
  }
}
```

---

### Implementing a details page: navigation

```dart
InkWell(
        onTap: () => Navigator.push(context,
            MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NewsDetailsPage(article))),
        child: Card(
            child: Row(
          children: [
            Container(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
                width: 150,
                height: 150,
                child: Image.network(
